Data scientist jobs case study is a dataset that is solved using different excel functions 

I recently worked on an insightful Data Scientist jobs case study, which involved analyzing a dataset with fields like Company, Company Score, Job Title, Date, Salary, Estimation Type, Remote, City, and Country. The project gave me the opportunity to apply a wide range of Excel functions to extract valuable insights from the data.

One of the tasks was to sort the salary in descending order and arrange the company names in ascending order, which helped identify the top-paying firms. I also calculated the total salary in the dataset using the SUM function and counted the total records using COUNT, giving me a clear understanding of the dataset's scope. For a specific record with salary 64480, I applied the VLOOKUP function to quickly identify the corresponding job title.

Further analysis included determining the total salary for Razorpoint and the total count of company scores for Data Scientist roles, which I achieved using DSUM and COUNTIF functions. The average salary for Senior Data Scientists was computed using the DAVERAGE function, providing insights into compensation trends.

To refine the data, I used filtering techniques to focus on Data Scientist roles and joined the company values and job titles using the CONCAT function to create a more concise representation. Additionally, I applied DCOUNT, DPRODUCT, DSUM, and DAVERAGE to handle complex calculations and statistical measures. For roles classified by working patterns, I implemented a logical condition where onsite roles displayed ‘no WFH’ and remote roles were tagged as ‘WFH’, ensuring a clear distinction.

This case study was a great opportunity to sharpen my data analysis skills in Excel, enabling me to gain actionable insights into job trends and salary patterns in the Data Science field.
